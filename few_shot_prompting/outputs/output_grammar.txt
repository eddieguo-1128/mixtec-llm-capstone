### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Mixtec Verb Conjugation Table

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **ni-steén** [²ni s.²te³ẽ] | to teach     |

| **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **ni-stáan** [²ni s.³ta¹ã]   | to destroy   |
| **ndukú** [²ndu.³ku]  | **ndúkú** [³ndu.³ku]  | **ni-ndukú** [²ni ²ndu.³ku]  | to seek      |
| **kunu** [²ku.²nu]    | **kúnu** [³ku.²nu]    | **ni-kunu** [²ni ²ku.²nu]    | to sew       |
| **kata** [²ka.²ta]    | **jíta** [³ji.²ta]    | **ni-jita** [²ni ²ji.²ta]    | to sing      |
| **kasɨ** [²ka.²sɨ]    | **jésɨ** [³xe.²sɨ]    | **ni-jésɨ** [²ni ³xe.²sɨ]    | to close     |
| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions
| Conjunction         | Meaning                  |

| **na/ níní na**    | when                   |
| **ná/ níní**       | while                  |
| **nde**            | until, since           |
| **kue̱chi**         | no more                |

---

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.

  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions
| Conjunction         | Meaning                  |
|---------------------|--------------------------|
| **te**             | and, but                |

| **kue̱chi**         | no more                |

---

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Mixtec Verb Conjugation Table

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **ni-steén** [²ni s.²te³ẽ] | to teach     |

| **kasɨ** [²ka.²sɨ]    | **jésɨ** [³xe.²sɨ]    | **ni-jésɨ** [²ni ³xe.²sɨ]    | to close     |
| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Mixtec Verb Conjugation Table

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **ni-steén** [²ni s.²te³ẽ] | to teach     |
| **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **ni-skáji** [²ni s.³ka.²xi] | to feed      |
| **skɨvɨ** [s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | **skɨ́vɨ** [s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | **ni-skɨ́vɨ** [²ni s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | to put       |
| **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **ni-stáan** [²ni s.³ta¹ã]   | to destroy   |
| **ndukú** [²ndu.³ku]  | **ndúkú** [³ndu.³ku]  | **ni-ndukú** [²ni ²ndu.³ku]  | to seek      |
| **kunu** [²ku.²nu]    | **kúnu** [³ku.²nu]    | **ni-kunu** [²ni ²ku.²nu]    | to sew       |
| **kata** [²ka.²ta]    | **jíta** [³ji.²ta]    | **ni-jita** [²ni ²ji.²ta]    | to sing      |
| **kasɨ** [²ka.²sɨ]    | **jésɨ** [³xe.²sɨ]    | **ni-jésɨ** [²ni ³xe.²sɨ]    | to close     |
| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

| **ná/ níní**       | while                  |
| **nde**            | until, since           |
| **kue̱chi**         | no more                |

---

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**

|                       |           | ya̱          |           | s/he (god)          |
|                       |           | tɨ          |           | it (animal)         |
|                       |           | te          |           | it (water)          |

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Mixtec Verb Conjugation Table

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **ni-steén** [²ni s.²te³ẽ] | to teach     |
| **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **ni-skáji** [²ni s.³ka.²xi] | to feed      |

| **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **ni-stáan** [²ni s.³ta¹ã]   | to destroy   |
| **ndukú** [²ndu.³ku]  | **ndúkú** [³ndu.³ku]  | **ni-ndukú** [²ni ²ndu.³ku]  | to seek      |
| **kunu** [²ku.²nu]    | **kúnu** [³ku.²nu]    | **ni-kunu** [²ni ²ku.²nu]    | to sew       |
| **kata** [²ka.²ta]    | **jíta** [³ji.²ta]    | **ni-jita** [²ni ²ji.²ta]    | to sing      |
| **kasɨ** [²ka.²sɨ]    | **jésɨ** [³xe.²sɨ]    | **ni-jésɨ** [²ni ³xe.²sɨ]    | to close     |
| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions
| Conjunction         | Meaning                  |

| **na/ níní na**    | when                   |
| **ná/ níní**       | while                  |
| **nde**            | until, since           |
| **kue̱chi**         | no more                |

---

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

|                       |           | te          |           | it (water)          |

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

|                       |           | ya̱          |           | s/he (god)          |
|                       |           | tɨ          |           | it (animal)         |
|                       |           | te          |           | it (water)          |

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Mixtec Verb Conjugation Table

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **ni-steén** [²ni s.²te³ẽ] | to teach     |
| **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **ni-skáji** [²ni s.³ka.²xi] | to feed      |
| **skɨvɨ** [s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | **skɨ́vɨ** [s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | **ni-skɨ́vɨ** [²ni s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | to put       |
| **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **ni-stáan** [²ni s.³ta¹ã]   | to destroy   |
| **ndukú** [²ndu.³ku]  | **ndúkú** [³ndu.³ku]  | **ni-ndukú** [²ni ²ndu.³ku]  | to seek      |
| **kunu** [²ku.²nu]    | **kúnu** [³ku.²nu]    | **ni-kunu** [²ni ²ku.²nu]    | to sew       |
| **kata** [²ka.²ta]    | **jíta** [³ji.²ta]    | **ni-jita** [²ni ²ji.²ta]    | to sing      |
| **kasɨ** [²ka.²sɨ]    | **jésɨ** [³xe.²sɨ]    | **ni-jésɨ** [²ni ³xe.²sɨ]    | to close     |
| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**

|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Mixtec Verb Conjugation Table

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **ni-steén** [²ni s.²te³ẽ] | to teach     |
| **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **ni-skáji** [²ni s.³ka.²xi] | to feed      |
| **skɨvɨ** [s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | **skɨ́vɨ** [s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | **ni-skɨ́vɨ** [²ni s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | to put       |
| **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **ni-stáan** [²ni s.³ta¹ã]   | to destroy   |
| **ndukú** [²ndu.³ku]  | **ndúkú** [³ndu.³ku]  | **ni-ndukú** [²ni ²ndu.³ku]  | to seek      |
| **kunu** [²ku.²nu]    | **kúnu** [³ku.²nu]    | **ni-kunu** [²ni ²ku.²nu]    | to sew       |
| **kata** [²ka.²ta]    | **jíta** [³ji.²ta]    | **ni-jita** [²ni ²ji.²ta]    | to sing      |
| **kasɨ** [²ka.²sɨ]    | **jésɨ** [³xe.²sɨ]    | **ni-jésɨ** [²ni ³xe.²sɨ]    | to close     |
| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

| **núu**            | if                     |
| **na/ níní na**    | when                   |
| **ná/ níní**       | while                  |
| **nde**            | until, since           |
| **kue̱chi**         | no more                |

---

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Mixtec Verb Conjugation Table

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **ni-steén** [²ni s.²te³ẽ] | to teach     |
| **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **ni-skáji** [²ni s.³ka.²xi] | to feed      |

| **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **ni-stáan** [²ni s.³ta¹ã]   | to destroy   |
| **ndukú** [²ndu.³ku]  | **ndúkú** [³ndu.³ku]  | **ni-ndukú** [²ni ²ndu.³ku]  | to seek      |
| **kunu** [²ku.²nu]    | **kúnu** [³ku.²nu]    | **ni-kunu** [²ni ²ku.²nu]    | to sew       |
| **kata** [²ka.²ta]    | **jíta** [³ji.²ta]    | **ni-jita** [²ni ²ji.²ta]    | to sing      |
| **kasɨ** [²ka.²sɨ]    | **jésɨ** [³xe.²sɨ]    | **ni-jésɨ** [²ni ³xe.²sɨ]    | to close     |
| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

| **na/ níní na**    | when                   |
| **ná/ níní**       | while                  |
| **nde**            | until, since           |
| **kue̱chi**         | no more                |

---

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

|                       |           | te          |           | it (water)          |

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.

- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions
| Conjunction         | Meaning                  |

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions
| Conjunction         | Meaning                  |

| **na/ níní na**    | when                   |
| **ná/ níní**       | while                  |
| **nde**            | until, since           |
| **kue̱chi**         | no more                |

---

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Mixtec Verb Conjugation Table

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **ni-steén** [²ni s.²te³ẽ] | to teach     |
| **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **ni-skáji** [²ni s.³ka.²xi] | to feed      |

| **kata** [²ka.²ta]    | **jíta** [³ji.²ta]    | **ni-jita** [²ni ²ji.²ta]    | to sing      |
| **kasɨ** [²ka.²sɨ]    | **jésɨ** [³xe.²sɨ]    | **ni-jésɨ** [²ni ³xe.²sɨ]    | to close     |
| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Mixtec Verb Conjugation Table

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **ni-steén** [²ni s.²te³ẽ] | to teach     |
| **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **ni-skáji** [²ni s.³ka.²xi] | to feed      |
| **skɨvɨ** [s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | **skɨ́vɨ** [s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | **ni-skɨ́vɨ** [²ni s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | to put       |
| **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **ni-stáan** [²ni s.³ta¹ã]   | to destroy   |
| **ndukú** [²ndu.³ku]  | **ndúkú** [³ndu.³ku]  | **ni-ndukú** [²ni ²ndu.³ku]  | to seek      |
| **kunu** [²ku.²nu]    | **kúnu** [³ku.²nu]    | **ni-kunu** [²ni ²ku.²nu]    | to sew       |
| **kata** [²ka.²ta]    | **jíta** [³ji.²ta]    | **ni-jita** [²ni ²ji.²ta]    | to sing      |
| **kasɨ** [²ka.²sɨ]    | **jésɨ** [³xe.²sɨ]    | **ni-jésɨ** [²ni ³xe.²sɨ]    | to close     |
| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions
| Conjunction         | Meaning                  |

| **je̱e yu̱kúan**    | for                     |
| **suni**           | also                    |

### Subordinating Conjunctions

| **núu**            | if                     |
| **na/ níní na**    | when                   |
| **ná/ níní**       | while                  |
| **nde**            | until, since           |
| **kue̱chi**         | no more                |

---

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Mixtec Verb Conjugation Table

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **ni-steén** [²ni s.²te³ẽ] | to teach     |

| **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **ni-stáan** [²ni s.³ta¹ã]   | to destroy   |
| **ndukú** [²ndu.³ku]  | **ndúkú** [³ndu.³ku]  | **ni-ndukú** [²ni ²ndu.³ku]  | to seek      |
| **kunu** [²ku.²nu]    | **kúnu** [³ku.²nu]    | **ni-kunu** [²ni ²ku.²nu]    | to sew       |
| **kata** [²ka.²ta]    | **jíta** [³ji.²ta]    | **ni-jita** [²ni ²ji.²ta]    | to sing      |
| **kasɨ** [²ka.²sɨ]    | **jésɨ** [³xe.²sɨ]    | **ni-jésɨ** [²ni ³xe.²sɨ]    | to close     |
| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions
| Conjunction         | Meaning                  |

| **na/ níní na**    | when                   |
| **ná/ níní**       | while                  |
| **nde**            | until, since           |
| **kue̱chi**         | no more                |

---

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

| **kata** [²ka.²ta]    | **jíta** [³ji.²ta]    | **ni-jita** [²ni ²ji.²ta]    | to sing      |
| **kasɨ** [²ka.²sɨ]    | **jésɨ** [³xe.²sɨ]    | **ni-jésɨ** [²ni ³xe.²sɨ]    | to close     |
| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions
| Conjunction         | Meaning                  |
|---------------------|--------------------------|

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Mixtec Verb Conjugation Table

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **ni-steén** [²ni s.²te³ẽ] | to teach     |
| **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **ni-skáji** [²ni s.³ka.²xi] | to feed      |
| **skɨvɨ** [s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | **skɨ́vɨ** [s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | **ni-skɨ́vɨ** [²ni s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | to put       |
| **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **ni-stáan** [²ni s.³ta¹ã]   | to destroy   |
| **ndukú** [²ndu.³ku]  | **ndúkú** [³ndu.³ku]  | **ni-ndukú** [²ni ²ndu.³ku]  | to seek      |
| **kunu** [²ku.²nu]    | **kúnu** [³ku.²nu]    | **ni-kunu** [²ni ²ku.²nu]    | to sew       |
| **kata** [²ka.²ta]    | **jíta** [³ji.²ta]    | **ni-jita** [²ni ²ji.²ta]    | to sing      |
| **kasɨ** [²ka.²sɨ]    | **jésɨ** [³xe.²sɨ]    | **ni-jésɨ** [²ni ³xe.²sɨ]    | to close     |
| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

|                       |           | te          |           | it (water)          |

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Mixtec Verb Conjugation Table

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **ni-steén** [²ni s.²te³ẽ] | to teach     |
| **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **ni-skáji** [²ni s.³ka.²xi] | to feed      |
| **skɨvɨ** [s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | **skɨ́vɨ** [s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | **ni-skɨ́vɨ** [²ni s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | to put       |
| **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **ni-stáan** [²ni s.³ta¹ã]   | to destroy   |
| **ndukú** [²ndu.³ku]  | **ndúkú** [³ndu.³ku]  | **ni-ndukú** [²ni ²ndu.³ku]  | to seek      |
| **kunu** [²ku.²nu]    | **kúnu** [³ku.²nu]    | **ni-kunu** [²ni ²ku.²nu]    | to sew       |
| **kata** [²ka.²ta]    | **jíta** [³ji.²ta]    | **ni-jita** [²ni ²ji.²ta]    | to sing      |
| **kasɨ** [²ka.²sɨ]    | **jésɨ** [³xe.²sɨ]    | **ni-jésɨ** [²ni ³xe.²sɨ]    | to close     |
| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions
| Conjunction         | Meaning                  |
|---------------------|--------------------------|

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example

*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*

    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**

  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example

*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Mixtec Verb Conjugation Table

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **ni-steén** [²ni s.²te³ẽ] | to teach     |
| **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **ni-skáji** [²ni s.³ka.²xi] | to feed      |

| **kata** [²ka.²ta]    | **jíta** [³ji.²ta]    | **ni-jita** [²ni ²ji.²ta]    | to sing      |
| **kasɨ** [²ka.²sɨ]    | **jésɨ** [³xe.²sɨ]    | **ni-jésɨ** [²ni ³xe.²sɨ]    | to close     |
| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**

  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Mixtec Verb Conjugation Table

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **ni-steén** [²ni s.²te³ẽ] | to teach     |
| **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **ni-skáji** [²ni s.³ka.²xi] | to feed      |
| **skɨvɨ** [s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | **skɨ́vɨ** [s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | **ni-skɨ́vɨ** [²ni s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | to put       |
| **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **ni-stáan** [²ni s.³ta¹ã]   | to destroy   |
| **ndukú** [²ndu.³ku]  | **ndúkú** [³ndu.³ku]  | **ni-ndukú** [²ni ²ndu.³ku]  | to seek      |
| **kunu** [²ku.²nu]    | **kúnu** [³ku.²nu]    | **ni-kunu** [²ni ²ku.²nu]    | to sew       |
| **kata** [²ka.²ta]    | **jíta** [³ji.²ta]    | **ni-jita** [²ni ²ji.²ta]    | to sing      |
| **kasɨ** [²ka.²sɨ]    | **jésɨ** [³xe.²sɨ]    | **ni-jésɨ** [²ni ³xe.²sɨ]    | to close     |
| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Mixtec Verb Conjugation Table

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------|

| **kasɨ** [²ka.²sɨ]    | **jésɨ** [³xe.²sɨ]    | **ni-jésɨ** [²ni ³xe.²sɨ]    | to close     |
| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

| **kue̱chi**         | no more                |

---

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Mixtec Verb Conjugation Table

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------|

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example

*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **ni-steén** [²ni s.²te³ẽ] | to teach     |

| **kasɨ** [²ka.²sɨ]    | **jésɨ** [³xe.²sɨ]    | **ni-jésɨ** [²ni ³xe.²sɨ]    | to close     |
| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**

    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**

    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions
| Conjunction         | Meaning                  |

*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

|                       |           | tɨ          |           | it (animal)         |
|                       |           | te          |           | it (water)          |

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Mixtec Verb Conjugation Table

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **ni-steén** [²ni s.²te³ẽ] | to teach     |
| **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **ni-skáji** [²ni s.³ka.²xi] | to feed      |

| **kata** [²ka.²ta]    | **jíta** [³ji.²ta]    | **ni-jita** [²ni ²ji.²ta]    | to sing      |
| **kasɨ** [²ka.²sɨ]    | **jésɨ** [³xe.²sɨ]    | **ni-jésɨ** [²ni ³xe.²sɨ]    | to close     |
| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Mixtec Verb Conjugation Table

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions
| Conjunction         | Meaning                  |
|---------------------|--------------------------|

| **kue̱chi**         | no more                |

---

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**

    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

| **je̱e yu̱kúan**    | for                     |
| **suni**           | also                    |

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Mixtec Verb Conjugation Table

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **ni-steén** [²ni s.²te³ẽ] | to teach     |

| **kasɨ** [²ka.²sɨ]    | **jésɨ** [³xe.²sɨ]    | **ni-jésɨ** [²ni ³xe.²sɨ]    | to close     |
| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*

    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Mixtec Verb Conjugation Table

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **ni-steén** [²ni s.²te³ẽ] | to teach     |

| **kasɨ** [²ka.²sɨ]    | **jésɨ** [³xe.²sɨ]    | **ni-jésɨ** [²ni ³xe.²sɨ]    | to close     |
| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

|                       |           | te          |           | it (water)          |

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Mixtec Verb Conjugation Table

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **ni-steén** [²ni s.²te³ẽ] | to teach     |
| **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **ni-skáji** [²ni s.³ka.²xi] | to feed      |
| **skɨvɨ** [s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | **skɨ́vɨ** [s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | **ni-skɨ́vɨ** [²ni s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | to put       |
| **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **ni-stáan** [²ni s.³ta¹ã]   | to destroy   |
| **ndukú** [²ndu.³ku]  | **ndúkú** [³ndu.³ku]  | **ni-ndukú** [²ni ²ndu.³ku]  | to seek      |
| **kunu** [²ku.²nu]    | **kúnu** [³ku.²nu]    | **ni-kunu** [²ni ²ku.²nu]    | to sew       |
| **kata** [²ka.²ta]    | **jíta** [³ji.²ta]    | **ni-jita** [²ni ²ji.²ta]    | to sing      |
| **kasɨ** [²ka.²sɨ]    | **jésɨ** [³xe.²sɨ]    | **ni-jésɨ** [²ni ³xe.²sɨ]    | to close     |
| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

|                       |           | ya̱          |           | s/he (god)          |
|                       |           | tɨ          |           | it (animal)         |
|                       |           | te          |           | it (water)          |

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Mixtec Verb Conjugation Table

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example

*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions
| Conjunction         | Meaning                  |

| **je̱e yu̱kúan**    | for                     |
| **suni**           | also                    |

### Subordinating Conjunctions

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Mixtec Verb Conjugation Table

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **ni-steén** [²ni s.²te³ẽ] | to teach     |
| **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **ni-skáji** [²ni s.³ka.²xi] | to feed      |
| **skɨvɨ** [s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | **skɨ́vɨ** [s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | **ni-skɨ́vɨ** [²ni s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | to put       |
| **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **ni-stáan** [²ni s.³ta¹ã]   | to destroy   |
| **ndukú** [²ndu.³ku]  | **ndúkú** [³ndu.³ku]  | **ni-ndukú** [²ni ²ndu.³ku]  | to seek      |
| **kunu** [²ku.²nu]    | **kúnu** [³ku.²nu]    | **ni-kunu** [²ni ²ku.²nu]    | to sew       |
| **kata** [²ka.²ta]    | **jíta** [³ji.²ta]    | **ni-jita** [²ni ²ji.²ta]    | to sing      |
| **kasɨ** [²ka.²sɨ]    | **jésɨ** [³xe.²sɨ]    | **ni-jésɨ** [²ni ³xe.²sɨ]    | to close     |
| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions
| Conjunction         | Meaning                  |
|---------------------|--------------------------|

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

# Pronouns

## Personal Pronouns

Personal pronouns are richly represented in Mixtec.

### Personal Pronouns in Atatláhuca Mixtec

|                       |           | ya̱          |           | s/he (god)          |
|                       |           | tɨ          |           | it (animal)         |
|                       |           | te          |           | it (water)          |

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Mixtec Verb Conjugation Table

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **ni-steén** [²ni s.²te³ẽ] | to teach     |
| **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **ni-skáji** [²ni s.³ka.²xi] | to feed      |
| **skɨvɨ** [s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | **skɨ́vɨ** [s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | **ni-skɨ́vɨ** [²ni s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | to put       |
| **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **ni-stáan** [²ni s.³ta¹ã]   | to destroy   |
| **ndukú** [²ndu.³ku]  | **ndúkú** [³ndu.³ku]  | **ni-ndukú** [²ni ²ndu.³ku]  | to seek      |
| **kunu** [²ku.²nu]    | **kúnu** [³ku.²nu]    | **ni-kunu** [²ni ²ku.²nu]    | to sew       |
| **kata** [²ka.²ta]    | **jíta** [³ji.²ta]    | **ni-jita** [²ni ²ji.²ta]    | to sing      |
| **kasɨ** [²ka.²sɨ]    | **jésɨ** [³xe.²sɨ]    | **ni-jésɨ** [²ni ³xe.²sɨ]    | to close     |
| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions
| Conjunction         | Meaning                  |
|---------------------|--------------------------|
| **te**             | and, but                |

| **yu̱kúan na**      | then, so                |
| **yu̱kúan**         | so                      |
| **je̱e yu̱kúan**    | for                     |
| **suni**           | also                    |

### Subordinating Conjunctions
| Conjunction         | Meaning                  |
|---------------------|--------------------------|

| **nájnu̱n**         | how                    |
| **ve̱sú**           | although               |
| **núu**            | if                     |
| **na/ níní na**    | when                   |
| **ná/ níní**       | while                  |
| **nde**            | until, since           |
| **kue̱chi**         | no more                |

---

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Mixtec Verb Conjugation Table

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **ni-steén** [²ni s.²te³ẽ] | to teach     |

| **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **ni-stáan** [²ni s.³ta¹ã]   | to destroy   |
| **ndukú** [²ndu.³ku]  | **ndúkú** [³ndu.³ku]  | **ni-ndukú** [²ni ²ndu.³ku]  | to seek      |
| **kunu** [²ku.²nu]    | **kúnu** [³ku.²nu]    | **ni-kunu** [²ni ²ku.²nu]    | to sew       |
| **kata** [²ka.²ta]    | **jíta** [³ji.²ta]    | **ni-jita** [²ni ²ji.²ta]    | to sing      |
| **kasɨ** [²ka.²sɨ]    | **jésɨ** [³xe.²sɨ]    | **ni-jésɨ** [²ni ³xe.²sɨ]    | to close     |
| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

| **kasɨ** [²ka.²sɨ]    | **jésɨ** [³xe.²sɨ]    | **ni-jésɨ** [²ni ³xe.²sɨ]    | to close     |
| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Mixtec Verb Conjugation Table

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **ni-steén** [²ni s.²te³ẽ] | to teach     |
| **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **ni-skáji** [²ni s.³ka.²xi] | to feed      |
| **skɨvɨ** [s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | **skɨ́vɨ** [s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | **ni-skɨ́vɨ** [²ni s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | to put       |
| **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **ni-stáan** [²ni s.³ta¹ã]   | to destroy   |
| **ndukú** [²ndu.³ku]  | **ndúkú** [³ndu.³ku]  | **ni-ndukú** [²ni ²ndu.³ku]  | to seek      |
| **kunu** [²ku.²nu]    | **kúnu** [³ku.²nu]    | **ni-kunu** [²ni ²ku.²nu]    | to sew       |
| **kata** [²ka.²ta]    | **jíta** [³ji.²ta]    | **ni-jita** [²ni ²ji.²ta]    | to sing      |
| **kasɨ** [²ka.²sɨ]    | **jésɨ** [³xe.²sɨ]    | **ni-jésɨ** [²ni ³xe.²sɨ]    | to close     |
| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*

*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Mixtec Verb Conjugation Table

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **ni-steén** [²ni s.²te³ẽ] | to teach     |
| **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **ni-skáji** [²ni s.³ka.²xi] | to feed      |

| **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **ni-stáan** [²ni s.³ta¹ã]   | to destroy   |
| **ndukú** [²ndu.³ku]  | **ndúkú** [³ndu.³ku]  | **ni-ndukú** [²ni ²ndu.³ku]  | to seek      |
| **kunu** [²ku.²nu]    | **kúnu** [³ku.²nu]    | **ni-kunu** [²ni ²ku.²nu]    | to sew       |
| **kata** [²ka.²ta]    | **jíta** [³ji.²ta]    | **ni-jita** [²ni ²ji.²ta]    | to sing      |
| **kasɨ** [²ka.²sɨ]    | **jésɨ** [³xe.²sɨ]    | **ni-jésɨ** [²ni ³xe.²sɨ]    | to close     |
| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Mixtec Verb Conjugation Table

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |

| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.

  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position

- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**

**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **ni-steén** [²ni s.²te³ẽ] | to teach     |

| **kasɨ** [²ka.²sɨ]    | **jésɨ** [³xe.²sɨ]    | **ni-jésɨ** [²ni ³xe.²sɨ]    | to close     |
| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**

  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Mixtec Verb Conjugation Table

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **ni-steén** [²ni s.²te³ẽ] | to teach     |
| **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **ni-skáji** [²ni s.³ka.²xi] | to feed      |

| **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **ni-stáan** [²ni s.³ta¹ã]   | to destroy   |
| **ndukú** [²ndu.³ku]  | **ndúkú** [³ndu.³ku]  | **ni-ndukú** [²ni ²ndu.³ku]  | to seek      |
| **kunu** [²ku.²nu]    | **kúnu** [³ku.²nu]    | **ni-kunu** [²ni ²ku.²nu]    | to sew       |
| **kata** [²ka.²ta]    | **jíta** [³ji.²ta]    | **ni-jita** [²ni ²ji.²ta]    | to sing      |
| **kasɨ** [²ka.²sɨ]    | **jésɨ** [³xe.²sɨ]    | **ni-jésɨ** [²ni ³xe.²sɨ]    | to close     |
| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

| **na/ níní na**    | when                   |
| **ná/ níní**       | while                  |
| **nde**            | until, since           |
| **kue̱chi**         | no more                |

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

| **kasɨ** [²ka.²sɨ]    | **jésɨ** [³xe.²sɨ]    | **ni-jésɨ** [²ni ³xe.²sɨ]    | to close     |
| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**

  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example

*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **ni-steén** [²ni s.²te³ẽ] | to teach     |

| **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **ni-stáan** [²ni s.³ta¹ã]   | to destroy   |
| **ndukú** [²ndu.³ku]  | **ndúkú** [³ndu.³ku]  | **ni-ndukú** [²ni ²ndu.³ku]  | to seek      |
| **kunu** [²ku.²nu]    | **kúnu** [³ku.²nu]    | **ni-kunu** [²ni ²ku.²nu]    | to sew       |
| **kata** [²ka.²ta]    | **jíta** [³ji.²ta]    | **ni-jita** [²ni ²ji.²ta]    | to sing      |
| **kasɨ** [²ka.²sɨ]    | **jésɨ** [³xe.²sɨ]    | **ni-jésɨ** [²ni ³xe.²sɨ]    | to close     |
| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Mixtec Verb Conjugation Table

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **ni-steén** [²ni s.²te³ẽ] | to teach     |
| **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **ni-skáji** [²ni s.³ka.²xi] | to feed      |
| **skɨvɨ** [s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | **skɨ́vɨ** [s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | **ni-skɨ́vɨ** [²ni s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | to put       |
| **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **ni-stáan** [²ni s.³ta¹ã]   | to destroy   |
| **ndukú** [²ndu.³ku]  | **ndúkú** [³ndu.³ku]  | **ni-ndukú** [²ni ²ndu.³ku]  | to seek      |
| **kunu** [²ku.²nu]    | **kúnu** [³ku.²nu]    | **ni-kunu** [²ni ²ku.²nu]    | to sew       |
| **kata** [²ka.²ta]    | **jíta** [³ji.²ta]    | **ni-jita** [²ni ²ji.²ta]    | to sing      |
| **kasɨ** [²ka.²sɨ]    | **jésɨ** [³xe.²sɨ]    | **ni-jésɨ** [²ni ³xe.²sɨ]    | to close     |
| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

| **na/ níní na**    | when                   |
| **ná/ níní**       | while                  |
| **nde**            | until, since           |
| **kue̱chi**         | no more                |

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

|                       |           | te          |           | it (water)          |

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Mixtec Verb Conjugation Table

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **ni-steén** [²ni s.²te³ẽ] | to teach     |

| **kasɨ** [²ka.²sɨ]    | **jésɨ** [³xe.²sɨ]    | **ni-jésɨ** [²ni ³xe.²sɨ]    | to close     |
| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions
| Conjunction         | Meaning                  |

| **na/ níní na**    | when                   |
| **ná/ níní**       | while                  |
| **nde**            | until, since           |
| **kue̱chi**         | no more                |

---

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

|                       |           | te          |           | it (water)          |

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Mixtec Verb Conjugation Table

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Mixtec Verb Conjugation Table

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **ni-steén** [²ni s.²te³ẽ] | to teach     |
| **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **ni-skáji** [²ni s.³ka.²xi] | to feed      |
| **skɨvɨ** [s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | **skɨ́vɨ** [s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | **ni-skɨ́vɨ** [²ni s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | to put       |
| **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **ni-stáan** [²ni s.³ta¹ã]   | to destroy   |
| **ndukú** [²ndu.³ku]  | **ndúkú** [³ndu.³ku]  | **ni-ndukú** [²ni ²ndu.³ku]  | to seek      |
| **kunu** [²ku.²nu]    | **kúnu** [³ku.²nu]    | **ni-kunu** [²ni ²ku.²nu]    | to sew       |
| **kata** [²ka.²ta]    | **jíta** [³ji.²ta]    | **ni-jita** [²ni ²ji.²ta]    | to sing      |
| **kasɨ** [²ka.²sɨ]    | **jésɨ** [³xe.²sɨ]    | **ni-jésɨ** [²ni ³xe.²sɨ]    | to close     |
| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*

  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Mixtec Verb Conjugation Table

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **ni-steén** [²ni s.²te³ẽ] | to teach     |

| **kasɨ** [²ka.²sɨ]    | **jésɨ** [³xe.²sɨ]    | **ni-jésɨ** [²ni ³xe.²sɨ]    | to close     |
| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)

# Pronouns

## Personal Pronouns

Personal pronouns are richly represented in Mixtec.

|                       |           | tɨ          |           | it (animal)         |
|                       |           | te          |           | it (water)          |

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Mixtec Verb Conjugation Table

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **ni-steén** [²ni s.²te³ẽ] | to teach     |
| **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **ni-skáji** [²ni s.³ka.²xi] | to feed      |
| **skɨvɨ** [s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | **skɨ́vɨ** [s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | **ni-skɨ́vɨ** [²ni s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | to put       |
| **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **ni-stáan** [²ni s.³ta¹ã]   | to destroy   |
| **ndukú** [²ndu.³ku]  | **ndúkú** [³ndu.³ku]  | **ni-ndukú** [²ni ²ndu.³ku]  | to seek      |
| **kunu** [²ku.²nu]    | **kúnu** [³ku.²nu]    | **ni-kunu** [²ni ²ku.²nu]    | to sew       |
| **kata** [²ka.²ta]    | **jíta** [³ji.²ta]    | **ni-jita** [²ni ²ji.²ta]    | to sing      |
| **kasɨ** [²ka.²sɨ]    | **jésɨ** [³xe.²sɨ]    | **ni-jésɨ** [²ni ³xe.²sɨ]    | to close     |
| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions
| Conjunction         | Meaning                  |
|---------------------|--------------------------|

| **na/ níní na**    | when                   |
| **ná/ níní**       | while                  |
| **nde**            | until, since           |
| **kue̱chi**         | no more                |

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Mixtec Verb Conjugation Table

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions
| Conjunction         | Meaning                  |

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions
| Conjunction         | Meaning                  |
|---------------------|--------------------------|

| **kue̱chi**         | no more                |

---

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions
| Conjunction         | Meaning                  |

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Mixtec Verb Conjugation Table

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **ni-steén** [²ni s.²te³ẽ] | to teach     |
| **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **ni-skáji** [²ni s.³ka.²xi] | to feed      |
| **skɨvɨ** [s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | **skɨ́vɨ** [s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | **ni-skɨ́vɨ** [²ni s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | to put       |
| **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **ni-stáan** [²ni s.³ta¹ã]   | to destroy   |
| **ndukú** [²ndu.³ku]  | **ndúkú** [³ndu.³ku]  | **ni-ndukú** [²ni ²ndu.³ku]  | to seek      |

| **kata** [²ka.²ta]    | **jíta** [³ji.²ta]    | **ni-jita** [²ni ²ji.²ta]    | to sing      |
| **kasɨ** [²ka.²sɨ]    | **jésɨ** [³xe.²sɨ]    | **ni-jésɨ** [²ni ³xe.²sɨ]    | to close     |
| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**

|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**

    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Mixtec Verb Conjugation Table

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **ni-steén** [²ni s.²te³ẽ] | to teach     |
| **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **ni-skáji** [²ni s.³ka.²xi] | to feed      |

| **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **ni-stáan** [²ni s.³ta¹ã]   | to destroy   |
| **ndukú** [²ndu.³ku]  | **ndúkú** [³ndu.³ku]  | **ni-ndukú** [²ni ²ndu.³ku]  | to seek      |
| **kunu** [²ku.²nu]    | **kúnu** [³ku.²nu]    | **ni-kunu** [²ni ²ku.²nu]    | to sew       |
| **kata** [²ka.²ta]    | **jíta** [³ji.²ta]    | **ni-jita** [²ni ²ji.²ta]    | to sing      |
| **kasɨ** [²ka.²sɨ]    | **jésɨ** [³xe.²sɨ]    | **ni-jésɨ** [²ni ³xe.²sɨ]    | to close     |
| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

| **na/ níní na**    | when                   |
| **ná/ níní**       | while                  |
| **nde**            | until, since           |
| **kue̱chi**         | no more                |

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Mixtec Verb Conjugation Table

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------|

| **kasɨ** [²ka.²sɨ]    | **jésɨ** [³xe.²sɨ]    | **ni-jésɨ** [²ni ³xe.²sɨ]    | to close     |
| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

| **kue̱chi**         | no more                |

---

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

| **kasɨ** [²ka.²sɨ]    | **jésɨ** [³xe.²sɨ]    | **ni-jésɨ** [²ni ³xe.²sɨ]    | to close     |
| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

| **kue̱chi**         | no more                |

---

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs

    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **ni-steén** [²ni s.²te³ẽ] | to teach     |

| **skɨvɨ** [s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | **skɨ́vɨ** [s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | **ni-skɨ́vɨ** [²ni s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | to put       |
| **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **ni-stáan** [²ni s.³ta¹ã]   | to destroy   |
| **ndukú** [²ndu.³ku]  | **ndúkú** [³ndu.³ku]  | **ni-ndukú** [²ni ²ndu.³ku]  | to seek      |
| **kunu** [²ku.²nu]    | **kúnu** [³ku.²nu]    | **ni-kunu** [²ni ²ku.²nu]    | to sew       |
| **kata** [²ka.²ta]    | **jíta** [³ji.²ta]    | **ni-jita** [²ni ²ji.²ta]    | to sing      |
| **kasɨ** [²ka.²sɨ]    | **jésɨ** [³xe.²sɨ]    | **ni-jésɨ** [²ni ³xe.²sɨ]    | to close     |
| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:

       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Mixtec Verb Conjugation Table

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **ni-steén** [²ni s.²te³ẽ] | to teach     |
| **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **ni-skáji** [²ni s.³ka.²xi] | to feed      |
| **skɨvɨ** [s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | **skɨ́vɨ** [s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | **ni-skɨ́vɨ** [²ni s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | to put       |
| **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **ni-stáan** [²ni s.³ta¹ã]   | to destroy   |
| **ndukú** [²ndu.³ku]  | **ndúkú** [³ndu.³ku]  | **ni-ndukú** [²ni ²ndu.³ku]  | to seek      |
| **kunu** [²ku.²nu]    | **kúnu** [³ku.²nu]    | **ni-kunu** [²ni ²ku.²nu]    | to sew       |
| **kata** [²ka.²ta]    | **jíta** [³ji.²ta]    | **ni-jita** [²ni ²ji.²ta]    | to sing      |
| **kasɨ** [²ka.²sɨ]    | **jésɨ** [³xe.²sɨ]    | **ni-jésɨ** [²ni ³xe.²sɨ]    | to close     |
| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

| **yu̱kúan**         | so                      |
| **je̱e yu̱kúan**    | for                     |
| **suni**           | also                    |

### Subordinating Conjunctions

| **núu**            | if                     |
| **na/ níní na**    | when                   |
| **ná/ níní**       | while                  |
| **nde**            | until, since           |
| **kue̱chi**         | no more                |

---

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Mixtec Verb Conjugation Table

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |

| **kasɨ** [²ka.²sɨ]    | **jésɨ** [³xe.²sɨ]    | **ni-jésɨ** [²ni ³xe.²sɨ]    | to close     |
| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions
| Conjunction         | Meaning                  |

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**

  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**

    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

| **kasɨ** [²ka.²sɨ]    | **jésɨ** [³xe.²sɨ]    | **ni-jésɨ** [²ni ³xe.²sɨ]    | to close     |
| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*

*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

|                       |           | tɨ          |           | it (animal)         |
|                       |           | te          |           | it (water)          |

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Mixtec Verb Conjugation Table

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **ni-steén** [²ni s.²te³ẽ] | to teach     |
| **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **ni-skáji** [²ni s.³ka.²xi] | to feed      |
| **skɨvɨ** [s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | **skɨ́vɨ** [s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | **ni-skɨ́vɨ** [²ni s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | to put       |
| **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **ni-stáan** [²ni s.³ta¹ã]   | to destroy   |
| **ndukú** [²ndu.³ku]  | **ndúkú** [³ndu.³ku]  | **ni-ndukú** [²ni ²ndu.³ku]  | to seek      |
| **kunu** [²ku.²nu]    | **kúnu** [³ku.²nu]    | **ni-kunu** [²ni ²ku.²nu]    | to sew       |
| **kata** [²ka.²ta]    | **jíta** [³ji.²ta]    | **ni-jita** [²ni ²ji.²ta]    | to sing      |
| **kasɨ** [²ka.²sɨ]    | **jésɨ** [³xe.²sɨ]    | **ni-jésɨ** [²ni ³xe.²sɨ]    | to close     |
| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions
| Conjunction         | Meaning                  |

| **núu**            | if                     |
| **na/ níní na**    | when                   |
| **ná/ níní**       | while                  |
| **nde**            | until, since           |
| **kue̱chi**         | no more                |

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example

*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*

    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Mixtec Verb Conjugation Table

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |

| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Mixtec Verb Conjugation Table

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **ni-steén** [²ni s.²te³ẽ] | to teach     |
| **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **ni-skáji** [²ni s.³ka.²xi] | to feed      |
| **skɨvɨ** [s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | **skɨ́vɨ** [s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | **ni-skɨ́vɨ** [²ni s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | to put       |
| **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **ni-stáan** [²ni s.³ta¹ã]   | to destroy   |
| **ndukú** [²ndu.³ku]  | **ndúkú** [³ndu.³ku]  | **ni-ndukú** [²ni ²ndu.³ku]  | to seek      |
| **kunu** [²ku.²nu]    | **kúnu** [³ku.²nu]    | **ni-kunu** [²ni ²ku.²nu]    | to sew       |
| **kata** [²ka.²ta]    | **jíta** [³ji.²ta]    | **ni-jita** [²ni ²ji.²ta]    | to sing      |
| **kasɨ** [²ka.²sɨ]    | **jésɨ** [³xe.²sɨ]    | **ni-jésɨ** [²ni ³xe.²sɨ]    | to close     |
| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Mixtec Verb Conjugation Table

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **ni-steén** [²ni s.²te³ẽ] | to teach     |
| **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **ni-skáji** [²ni s.³ka.²xi] | to feed      |
| **skɨvɨ** [s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | **skɨ́vɨ** [s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | **ni-skɨ́vɨ** [²ni s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | to put       |
| **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **ni-stáan** [²ni s.³ta¹ã]   | to destroy   |
| **ndukú** [²ndu.³ku]  | **ndúkú** [³ndu.³ku]  | **ni-ndukú** [²ni ²ndu.³ku]  | to seek      |
| **kunu** [²ku.²nu]    | **kúnu** [³ku.²nu]    | **ni-kunu** [²ni ²ku.²nu]    | to sew       |
| **kata** [²ka.²ta]    | **jíta** [³ji.²ta]    | **ni-jita** [²ni ²ji.²ta]    | to sing      |
| **kasɨ** [²ka.²sɨ]    | **jésɨ** [³xe.²sɨ]    | **ni-jésɨ** [²ni ³xe.²sɨ]    | to close     |
| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.

  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions
| Conjunction         | Meaning                  |
|---------------------|--------------------------|

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**

  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs

  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

---

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.

### Coordinating Conjunctions
| Conjunction         | Meaning                  |

| **kue̱chi**         | no more                |

---

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

### Mixtec Verb Conjugation Table

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **ni-steén** [²ni s.²te³ẽ] | to teach     |
| **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **skáji** [s.³ka.²xi] | **ni-skáji** [²ni s.³ka.²xi] | to feed      |
| **skɨvɨ** [s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | **skɨ́vɨ** [s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | **ni-skɨ́vɨ** [²ni s.³kɨ.²vɨ] | to put       |
| **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **stáan** [s.³ta¹ã]   | **ni-stáan** [²ni s.³ta¹ã]   | to destroy   |
| **ndukú** [²ndu.³ku]  | **ndúkú** [³ndu.³ku]  | **ni-ndukú** [²ni ²ndu.³ku]  | to seek      |
| **kunu** [²ku.²nu]    | **kúnu** [³ku.²nu]    | **ni-kunu** [²ni ²ku.²nu]    | to sew       |
| **kata** [²ka.²ta]    | **jíta** [³ji.²ta]    | **ni-jita** [²ni ²ji.²ta]    | to sing      |
| **kasɨ** [²ka.²sɨ]    | **jésɨ** [³xe.²sɨ]    | **ni-jésɨ** [²ni ³xe.²sɨ]    | to close     |
| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*

  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

## Word Order in the Clause

Mixtec typically follows a **verb–subject–object (VSO)** word order. Variations in this order are used for emphasis or to highlight certain information, particularly through the use of the **preverbal position**.

### Example
**Jíín te̱e va̱ni ró.**  
*"And the man did well."*  
- **Verb**: va̱ni (*did well*)  
- **Subject**: te̱e (*the man*)  
- **Object**: ró (*you*)

### First and Second Person Pronouns

Many varieties (but not all) have distinct "formal" and "informal" pronouns for first and second person (except in the first person plural inclusive). 

- **Usage of Formal and Informal Pronouns**:  
  - When addressing someone of their own age or older, the speaker uses the formal pronouns.  
  - When addressing a younger person, the speaker uses the informal pronouns.  

- **Singular and Plural Interpretation**:  
  - First person exclusive pronouns may be interpreted as singular or plural.  
  - Second person pronouns may also be interpreted as singular or plural.  

- **Inclusive Form**:  
  - A first person inclusive form is common, including both the speaker and the hearer.  

- **Independent and Dependent Forms**:  
  - **Independent Forms**: Used in general contexts.  
  - **Dependent (Enclitic) Forms**: Used when the pronoun follows a verb (as subject) or a noun (as possessor).  

### Examples

#### Personal Pronoun as Direct Object
**Jiní knóws de sa̱ñá**  
*"He knows me."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Preverbal Position
**Ró'ó kí'i̱n va̱'a ga**  
*"It will be better if you go."*

#### Personal Pronoun in Normal Subject Position
**Va̱ni nisá'a ró**  
*"You did well."*

### Third Person Pronouns

Mixtec has several third person pronouns that indicate specific characteristics of the referent, such as gender, age, or entity type:

- **Man and Woman**: Pronouns for male and female adults.
- **Animal**: Pronoun for animals.
- **Child**: Pronoun for children.
- **Sacred or Divine Entities**: Pronoun for gods.
- **Inanimate Objects**: Pronoun for objects like water.  

Some languages include respect forms or pronouns for other categories, such as trees. These pronouns often show etymological links to nouns (e.g., "man", "woman", "tree") but are distinct from them.

- **Pluralization**:  
  - Common plural marker **de** can be used.  
  - Some varieties have explicit plural forms that have evolved.

## Interrogative Pronouns

Mixtec has two interrogative pronouns:  

- **na vé** ([²na ³ve]) = "what/which?"  
- **nasaa** ([²na.²saa]) = "how much/many?"  

The tone of these pronouns does not change based on tense, person, or the tone of the surrounding phrase.

---

## Verbs

### Verb Characteristics
- **No Infinitive Form**:  
  Mixtec verbs lack an infinitive form. The basic form of the verb is the **future tense**, which is also often used for the **present tense**.
  
- **Irregular Verbs**:  
  - To form the **present tense** of irregular verbs, the tone is modified according to complex prosodic rules.  
  - For a subset of irregular verbs beginning with [k], the sound mutates to either [xe] or [xi] in the present tense.

- **Preterite (Past Tense)**:  
  - The particle **ni-** ([²ni]) is added to form the past tense.  
  - This particle causes a **tonal shift** in the following verb.  
  - While **ni-** can be omitted in informal speech, the tonal modification always occurs.  

- **Simplified Tense System**:  
  - Mixtec does not have imperfect, pluperfect, or compound tenses found in other languages.  
  - Verb conjugations do not mark person or number, resembling English in this respect more than Spanish.

### Examples of Verb Usage in Sentences

#### Future Tense
**Te máá ró sanaa te kusɨɨ ni ro̱ te kiji ró ɨɨn jínu nájnu'un domingu te kinu'un ro̱.**  
*"And perhaps you shall be happy, shall come on Sunday, and shall return home."*

---

#### Present Tense
**Tu jíní-yo̱ ndese skánda-de te jíka kamión.**  
*"We don't know what he does to make the truck go."*

---

#### Preterite Tense
**Ni-steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
**Steén-de nuu̱ ná.**  
*"He taught me."*

## Verb Conjugation in Mixtec

### Understanding the Digits in Phonetic Notation
The numbers in the phonetic transcriptions represent **tones**. In tonal languages like Mixtec, the tone of a syllable can change the meaning of a word or verb form. These numbers correspond to pitch levels:  

- **¹**: Low tone  
- **²**: Mid tone  
- **³**: High tone  

Tonal changes in Mixtec verbs are crucial for distinguishing between tenses and sometimes meanings.

| Future                | Present               | Past                   | Meaning      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **stéén** [s.³teẽ]    | **ni-steén** [²ni s.²te³ẽ] | to teach     |

| **kasɨ** [²ka.²sɨ]    | **jésɨ** [³xe.²sɨ]    | **ni-jésɨ** [²ni ³xe.²sɨ]    | to close     |
| **kua̱'a** [²ku¹a'.²a] | **jé'e** [²xe.²e]     | **ni-je̱'e** [²ni ¹xe'.²e]   | to give      |
| **kusu̱** [²ku.¹su]    | **kíxí** [³ki.³ʃi]    | **ni-kixi̱** [²ni ²ki.¹ʃi]   | to sleep     |

### Observations
1. **Tone Changes Between Tenses**:  
   - The **present tense** often involves tone modification compared to the **future tense**.
   - The addition of the **ni-** prefix in the **past tense** introduces tonal shifts, especially to the first syllable.

2. **Irregular Mutations**:  
   - Some verbs beginning with [k] in the **future tense** mutate to [xe] or [xi] in the **present tense** (e.g., "kasɨ" → "jésɨ").

3. **Tonal Complexity**:  
   - The tonal shifts play a vital role in distinguishing tense and maintaining meaning.  
   - In tonal analysis, the pitch contour of the verb root changes in predictable patterns influenced by prefixes and grammatical function.

### Conclusion
Mixtec verb conjugation relies heavily on tonal and phonetic transformations to encode tense, making it distinct from languages with inflectional morphology based on affixes or auxiliary verbs.

## Verb Classes

### Causative Verbs
Causative verbs in Mixtec are modified by a prefix **s-**, indicating that the action is performed by the agent of the phrase. This prefix affects the orthography and pronunciation of the verb it modifies:

- **[ⁿd] → [t]** when the verb begins with [ⁿd].  
- **[j] → [i]** when the verb begins with [j].  

There is no distinction between future and present causative verbs, but the past tense is marked by adding the particle **ni-**.

#### Examples of Causative Verbs
- **Regular causative:**
  - Normal verb: **tɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"It shall decompose, it decomposes."*
  - Causative verb: **stɨ̱vɨ́**  
    *"He shall damage it, he damages it."*

- **Irregular causative (nd → t shift):**
  - Normal verb: **ndo'o-ña**  
    *"She shall suffer, she suffers."*
  - Causative verb: **stó'o-ña**  
    *"She shall cause to suffer, she causes to suffer."*

- **Irregular causative (y → i shift):**
  - Normal verb: **yu̱'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall fear, the animal fears."*
  - Causative verb: **siú'ú-tɨ́**  
    *"The animal shall cause fear, the animal causes fear."*

---

### Repetitive Verbs
The prefix **na-** indicates that the action is performed again, either by the subject or another unidentified agent. Some irregular verbs take [ⁿd] or [n] instead of **na-** as the repetitive prefix.

#### Examples of Repetitive Verbs
- **Regular repetitive verb:**
  - Normal verb: **Ki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall sew the clothes."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Naki̱ku-ña**  
    *"She shall repair the clothes."*

- **Regular repetitive verb (k → nd shift):**
  - Normal verb: **Kaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise."*
  - Repetitive verb: **Ndaa-de**  
    *"He shall rise again."*

---

### Copulative Verbs
Copulative verbs link nouns, adjectives, or pronouns. Mixtec has four copulative verbs:

1. **kuu** ("to be")  
2. **nduu** ("to be again," the repetitive form of **kuu**)  
3. **koo** ("to exist")  
4. **káá** ("to appear," used only in present and preterite tenses)

#### Examples of Copulative Verbs
- **kuu**:  
  - **Maéstru kúu-te̱e ún.**  
    *"The man is a teacher."*  

- **nduu**:  
  - **Maestru kúu.**  
    *"He is a teacher."*

- **koo**:  
  - **Ndíchí koo-ró.**  
    *"You will be intelligent."*

- **káá**:  
  - **Káa likuxi sɨkɨ̱ tɨ̱.**  
    *"The animal's back is grey."*

---

### Descriptive Verbs
Descriptive verbs can function as either verbs or adjectives. They are always in the present tense. For past or future meanings, a copulative verb is added.

#### Examples of Descriptive Verbs
- **Without copula:**  
  - **Kúká-de.**  
    *"He is rich."*  
  - **Ve̱yɨ nuní.**  
    *"The maize is heavy."*

- **With contracted copulas:**  
  - **Vijna te kúkúká-de.**  
    *"Now he is rich."*  
  - **Ni-ndukuká-de.**  
    *"He became rich again."*

---

### Modal Verbs
Modal verbs may be followed by another verb and occasionally by the relative pronoun **jee̱**. Examples include **kuu** ("can") and **kánuú** ("must").

#### Examples of Modal Verbs
- **Modal kuu (can):**  
  - **Kuu ka'u-de tatu.**  
    *"He will be able to read a book."*  

- **Modal kánuú (must):**  
  - **Kánuú je̱é ki'ín-de.**  
    *"He must go."*

### Verb Moods

#### Indicative Mood
Describes actions in real life that occur, have occurred, or will occur. The forms are described in the "Verb Tenses" section.

#### Imperative Mood
Formed by adding the particle **-ni** to the future indicative form. Negative imperatives are formed by adding **má** ("don't").

| Formal              | Informal            | Negative            |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Kaa̱n ní.**        | **Kaa̱n.**          | **Má kaa̱n ro̱.**    |
| *"Speak!"*          | *"Speak!"*          | *"Don't speak!"*    |

#### Subjunctive Mood
Indicates a mild command. Formed by placing the particle **na** before the future verb form.

- **Third-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kɨ́vɨ-de ve'e.**  
    *"Let him enter the house."*

- **First-person subjunctive:**  
  - **Na kí'ín-na.**  
    *"Then I shall go."*

#### Counter-Factual Mood
Indicates actions not performed or incomplete. Past counter-factuals are marked with **ní** and tonal changes.

- **With subordinate clause:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱ chi je ni-nduva̱'a-de.**  
    *"If he had taken the medicine, he would be better by now."*

- **Simple counter-factual:**  
  - **Ní-jí'í-de tajna̱.**  
    *"If only he had taken the medicine!"*

- **Future counter-factual with modal:**  
  - **Kiji-de te tu ni-kúu.**  
    *"He was going to come, but was unable to."*

## Nouns

### Overview
Nouns in Mixtec represent persons, animals, inanimate objects, or abstract ideas. However, Mixtec has relatively few nouns for abstract concepts, often using verbal constructions to express these ideas.  

- **Noun Phrase Structure**:  
  When a noun is followed by another noun in a phrase:
  - The first noun is the **nucleus**.
  - The second noun serves as a **modifier**, often indicating possession.

#### Examples
1. **Nouns as Modifiers**:  
   - **Ndu̱yu ka̱a**  
     *"Metal stake" (Nail)*  

2. **Modifiers Possessing the Nucleus**:  
   - **Ina te̱e yúkuan**  
     *"That man's dog"*

---

### Pluralization
Mixtec nouns are inherently singular. Pluralization can be indicated through grammatical and lexical tools:

1. **Plural Pronouns**:  
   The presence of a plural pronoun (e.g., first-person inclusive) implicitly pluralizes the noun.  
   - **Te máá yó-kúu ñayuu yúku ndé lugar yá'a.**  
     *"We are the ones who live in this place."*

2. **Affixes**:  
   - **Prefix ka-**:  
     - **Te sukúan kándo'o ñayuu.**  
       *"In that way people suffer."*  
   - **Suffix -koo**:  
     - **Te ni-kekoo te̱e ún.**  
       *"The men arrived."*

3. **Particle jijná'an**:  
   An untranslatable particle that can pluralize verbs, pronouns, or nouns.

---

### Demonstratives
Mixtec demonstratives act as adjectives in noun phrases, often appearing at the end of the phrase.  

- **Demonstrative Categories**:  
  - **Proximal**: Close to the speaker  
  - **Medial**: At an intermediate distance  
  - **Distal**: Far from the speaker  
  - **Out of Sight**: Indicates something not visible  

Some varieties also use demonstratives anaphorically (to refer to previously mentioned entities) or have special demonstratives solely for anaphoric use.

---

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions in Mixtec join words, phrases, or sentences. There are two types: **coordinating** and **subordinating**.
